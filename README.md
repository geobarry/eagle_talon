# Talon Eagle
Talon voice commands to control mouse using a first-person navigation perspective.
# Purpose
This is for people who have already set up talon voice to control their computer, but are looking for a better way to control the mouse using voice commands. Instead of a rectangular grid, Eagle uses a direction-then-distance protocol inspired by conventions used in surveying and navigation. 
# Installation
Clone it to your talon user folder, just like any other set of talon control files. 
# Basic Usage 
A basic sequence of commands goes something like this:
``` Eagle On ```  show a compass rose
``` North ```  ................ choose any cardinal direction; a navigation grid will appear showing direction adjustments and distances and pixels
``` 20 East ```  .............. adjust the cardinal direction
``` Fly 300 ```  .............. move the mouse a specified distance in pixels
``` Touch ```  ................ use standard talon mouse commands at any time
``` Eagle Off ```  ............ hide the navigation grid or compass rose
