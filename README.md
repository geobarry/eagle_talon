# Talon Eagle
Talon voice commands to control mouse using a first-person navigation perspective.
# Purpose
This is for people who have already set up talon voice to control their computer, but are looking for a better way to control the mouse using voice commands. Instead of a rectangular grid, Eagle uses a direction-then-distance protocol inspired by conventions used in surveying and navigation. The premise is that it is more natural and intuitive to move your mouse a specified direction and distance than it is to locate items on the screen by their horizontal and vertical positions. Your mileage may vary, but if you are using a standard mouse grid and you find that your brain takes a little while to figure out what number or letter to say, then give Eagle a try!
# Installation
### Existing talon users
Just copy or clone all files to somewhere in your talon user folder. 
### New talon users
1. Read up on how to install and get started with talon here:
   - https://talonvoice.com/
   - https://talon.wiki/
2. Once you are up and running, just copy or clone all files to somewhere in your talon user folder. 
# Usage
Explanation: the basic sequence involves three conceptual steps:
  1. Set an initial bearing direction
  2. Fine-tune the bearing direction 
  3. Move the mouse a given number of pixels

This process can be combined with standard Talon mouse control commands in any manner you like. 

### Examples
A basic sequence of commands goes something like this:  

``` Eagle north ```  
``` Fly 300 ```  
``` Touch ```  

A slightly more complicated sequence showing some additional capabilities:

``` Eagle Center```  
``` north-northeast ```  
``` 5 right ```  
``` Drag ```  
``` Walk 300 ```  
``` Backup 15 ```  
``` Drag End ```  
``` Eagle Reverse ```

# More Detailed Command List
(but maybe not comprehensive - always check actual talent files for most up to date list)

### Commands always available
``` Eagle On ```  
  * Starts Eagle from the current mouse position 

``` Eagle Center ```
  * Starts Eagle and places the mouse at the center of the screen

``` Eagle <compass direction> ```
  * Set the movement direction
  * options include ```North``` ```East``` ```South``` ```West``` ```northeast``` ```southeast``` ```southwest``` ```northwest``` ```north-northeast``` ```east-northeast``` ```east-southeast``` ```south-southeast``` ```south-southwest``` ```west-southwest``` ```west-northwest``` ```north-northwest``` ```up``` ```right``` ```down``` ```left```  

### Commands available whenever eagle is turned on
By default eagle starts automatically, so these commands are also available at startup.

``` Eagle (Jump|Fly|Walk|Crawl) <number> ```  
  * Move the mouse the specified distance in pixels in the direction of Eagle's current bearing

``` Eagle Reverse ```
  * reverses the compass direction

``` Eagle Display (heavy|medium|light|tiny) ```
  * Adjusts the size and density of the tick marks and labels showing distances and directions on screen

``` Eagle Off ```  
  * Turns off Eagle so that only "always available" commands are available

### Commands available when eagle is active 
Eagle remains active for approx. 15 seconds after every spoken eagle command, to allow more concise commands for continuation of mouse movement activity.

``` <number> <compass direction> ```  
  * shifts Eagle's bearing by the given number of degrees towards the given compass direction
  * This is actually very flexible - just say a number of degrees followed by any bearing direction in the general vicinity of where you want to go. For example, if your current bearing is northeast and you want to rotate clockwise 5 degrees, you can say "five east", "five south", "five right" or even "five east northeast". At present only integer values are allowed.

``` Nudge <compass direction> ```
  * shifts Eagle's bearing by 3/10th of a degree towards the given compass direction

``` (Back|Backup) <number> ```
  * moves the mouse backwards the specified distance in pixels

``` <compass direction> ```  
  * set Eagle's bearing to the given compass direction  
  * a navigation grid will appear showing direction adjustments (in degrees) and distances (in pixels)

``` Fly <number> ```  
  * moves the mouse the specified distance in pixels in the direction of Eagle's current bearing
  * Pro tip: When trying to click on something all the way across the screen, it may be difficult to get the bearing angle to land on exactly where you want to go. In this case, a good strategy is to bring the mouse close to but not quite all the way to your desired destination, then adjust the bearing a little bit and repeat. For example, if you want to hit a target that is 1000 pixels away to the upper right, you could say ```Eagle Northeast``` ```Fly 950``` to get into the general vicinity, then adjust the bearing more precisely for the final 50 pixels.
