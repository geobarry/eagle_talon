# talon_eagle
Talon voice commands to control mouse using a first-person navigation perspective.
# Who needs this?
This is for people who have already set up talon voice to control their computer, but are looking for a better way to control the mouse using voice commands.
# What's the big idea?
Mouse movement is critical for effectively controlling your computer with voice, so the process should be fast and intuitive. Instead of a rectangular grid, Eagle uses a direction-then-distance protocol inspired by conventions used in surveying and navigation. 
# How do I install this?
Clone it to your talon user folder, just like any other set of talon control files. 
# How do I use this? 
The basic set of commands goes something like this:
* Eagle On ............. show a compass rose
* North ................ choose any cardinal direction; a navigation grid will appear showing direction adjustments and distances and pixels
* 20 East .............. adjust the cardinal direction
* Fly 300 .............. move the mouse a specified distance in pixels
* Touch ................ use standard talon mouse commands at any time
* Eagle Off ............ hide the navigation grid or compass rose
